# Bouncy Window Manager

A very silly X window manager that bounces its windows around.

For https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/11/25/challenge--make-a-bouncy-window-manager/. After [the solutions post](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/12/03/solutions-to-the-tiny-window-manager-challenge/) mentioned there were few non-C solutions, I decided to give it a try in Rust.

Warning, **lots** of `unwrap` usage. You have been warned.
